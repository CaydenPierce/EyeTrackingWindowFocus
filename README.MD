# Workspace focus switching using eye-tracking

Control i3wm window focus just by looking at the window that you want to work on.

#Install

Clone sub-repo from [1]. Then pip3 install the subrepos requirements.txt. Then pip3 install i3ipc. This is assuming you have i3 already running.

You will have adjust the values in focus.py for your setup.

# TODO

Make a calibration script to make setup automatic (for everytime you nudge your webcam).
